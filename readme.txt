Hello!
This is a place sharing what I've learned. Hope you guys like it.

In first period, I plan to upload some implementation of algorithms. I believe solid algorithm foundation is rather improtant. 
Then I plan to write an IOS app. I have some preliminary ideas. Once I finish it, I'll upload it as well.

Hope I could get to some cool companies and hope every tech-lover could, too.

:-)
